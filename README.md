A Machine Learning model to identify the Age, Gender, and Plumage of a Bird Species

The comprehensive procedures involved in the development, training, and evaluation of a model for identifying the sex, age, and plumage of bird species using deep learning and neural networks with a pre-trained deep convolutional model are elaborated upon in the subsequent sections.
We have classified images of each bird into 4 subgroups. The subgroups are divided into “Breeding Male”, “Non-Breeding Male”, “Female” and “Juvenile”. The breeding and non-breeding male classification will help in identifying the plumage whereas the female and the two male classes will help in identifying the Gender. The juvenile class will help in identifying the age of the bird.

We have listed the accuracy of the four models and also plotted the data in a bar chart
